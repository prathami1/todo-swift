# Todo iOS Application
My first iOS Application, written in Swift and SwiftUI. Built with CoreData, designed to help plan one's busy day by offering ListView based functionality.

# Application in Use
Here are some screenshots of the application in action, highlighting some of its core features. Keep in mind this is my first Swift Application, so I decided to keep it relatively simple in order to get the hang of the basics.
